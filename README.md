# WinterTwined: Rite to Reign
Game submissoin to the Global Game Jam 2016

## Story:

Twins born of the Monarch must face a ritual to determine the next ruler. As far back as anyone can remember, the Queen gave birth to twins, but only one returned from the ritual. When the ritual begins one sibling is turned into an animal and dropped into a maze. With no map and no sense of direction the animal must rely on their twin, who has been turned into a dragon and is flying above the maze. The twins must use teamwork and communication to survive the monsters and escape the maze, but only one will earn the rite to reign. WinterTwined:Rite to Reign is a two player co-op game created in Unity. One player navigates through a maze in first person view while fighting ground enemies. The second player has a top-down view of the maze and a horde or flying enemies to contend with.
